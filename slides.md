# People flow

Kone moves over 1 billion people per day. Ensuring high accessibility and safety for the customer is at the heart of the company.

Predicting maintenence needs for the equipment is possible with machine learning and real time sensor data.


# The problem

Maintenance predictions have to be accurate: non-functioning equipment or an unnecessary visit by the technician is expensive.

ElevAI combines artificial intelligence and expert domain knowledge to ensure that equipment is serviced only when needed. ElevAI app enables feedback loop between the learning system and the technician.
